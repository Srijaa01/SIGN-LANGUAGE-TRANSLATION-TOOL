# SIGN-LANGUAGE-TRANSLATION-TOOL
 Sign Language Translation Tool. PURPOSE: The goal of sign language translation tools is to help people who are deaf or hard of hearing communicate with people who speak spoken languages more often. By translating gestures in sign language into spoken or written language aTITLEnd vice versa, they help, people to communicate. TECHNOLOGY USED: MediaPipe:-Landmark extraction and hand detection OpenCV :- Video processing and computer vision tasks Scikit-learn: KNN classifier for machine learning Pandas: Data processing (CSV, features/labels) NumPy :- Numerical operations Matplotlib: Colab's frame-by-frame visualization Google Colab: Executing the code in the cloud while uploading UI USAGE : By translating signs into text or speech and vice versa, sign language translation tools help people who use sign language and those who don't communicate with each other. These resources can be applied in a variety of contexts to encourage deaf and hard-of-hearing accessibility and inclusion. CONCLUSION :An important step toward closing the communication gap between the hearing and non-hearing communities is the Sign Language Translation Tool. The tool facilitates real-time translation of sign language into spoken or written language by utilizing contemporary technologies like computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing. This promotes accessibility andÂ inclusivity.
